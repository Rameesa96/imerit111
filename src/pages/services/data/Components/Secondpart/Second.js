                    <p className="secondpara">Data annotation is the process of labeling unstructured data and information to train machine learning models. Today we find ourselves surrounded by high volumes of raw data. This raw data comes in unique formats like images, video, text, and audio.

<p className="secondpara">Appropriately labeled, quality data is used to help supervised machine learning models identify objects, understand sentiment, and perform functions like speech recognition or even driving.</p>
