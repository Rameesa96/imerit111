                    <p className='thirdpara'>CrowdReason’s machine learning algorithm struggled to extract user-uploaded documents accurately. This resulted in CrowdReason employees having to manually correct the extractions, a process that was time-consuming. CrowdReason realized they needed a partner who could handle the time-consuming manual labor and also improve the machine learning algorithm’s accuracy.</p>

<p className='thirdpara'>iMerit’s text annotation teams customized an end-to-end data annotation workflow that simplified the data-extraction process. This allowed iMerit to immediately relieve CrowdReason employees while also allowing iMerit to continually pinpoint poor machine learning algorithm performance. With iMerit annotation, the machine learning algorithm’s performance improved, resulting in 80% time-savings for CrowdReason employees.</p>

<p className='thirdpara'>“iMerit was and continues to be, an invaluable partner for us. They provided us with accurate data early on, which helped us get up and running with the development of our tax property software.”–<strong>Brandon Van Volkenburgh, CTO & Co-founder, CrowdReason</strong> </p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>KinaTrax specializes in motion capture technology, and works with Major League Baseball (MLB) to improve player performance. After gathering terabytes of motion capture footage of MLB pitchers, KinaTrax came to iMerit for help creating 3D models that could be analyzed from every viewing angle.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>iMerit’s data annotation teams examined the motion capture footage and extracted still images across all twelve viewing angles. To create a 3D model, iMerit data annotators applied key points to each joint of the pitcher’s body. This resulted in over 300 3D models of MLB pitchers that could be analyzed for performance improvements endlessly.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>“iMerit’s data annotation services enable us to build accurate models for hundreds of MLB pitchers and turn these models into actionable insights. We look forward to working with iMerit for seasons to come!” – Steven Cadavid, President, Kinatrax</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara'>iMerit worked closely with American Ancestry to transcribe over 14M+ names from sacramental records taken between 1789 and 1900. Before iMerit, American Ancestry’s data scientists annotated data in-house using Microsoft Excel. After taking on this large volume of documentation, American Ancestors needed a data labeling partner who could meet their pricing requirements and make these names searchable for customers using their website.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara'>Working closely with the American Ancestry team, iMerit began iterating around which workflows could successfully meet the scale of the project within a reasonable time frame. The iMerit team sent this information to its centers of annotation excellence, where expert data annotators developed a workflow that accounted for the necessary genealogical expertise the project demanded. This combination of scale and genealogical expertise helped American Ancestors scale to the needs of the project.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara'>“Working with iMerit is an integral part of our mission to add new genealogical content to our website. By making these names available, we’re connecting people with tangible proof of their ancestors.” – Molly Rogers, Associate Director of Database Content, American Ancestors</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>Bill.com’s IVA, the intelligent virtual assistant, leverages computer-vision and deep-learning for data collection from user-uploaded business documents like invoices, statements, and receipts. After noticing that users were correcting IVA’s field extraction, Bill.com asked iMerit to help them improve IVA’s accuracy. Any improvement in accuracy stood to substantially improve the Bill.com user experience.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>To better understand where IVA wasn’t performing, iMerit began evaluating IVA’s performance across a series of documents. After running several annotations and checking with the Bill.com team, iMerit discovered an annotation method that would allow the Bill.com team to spot check IVA’s accuracy, and see if it was improving. iMerit then created training data by combining iMerit-annotated high-error user documentation with normal user documentation and successfully improved the accuracy of IVA by 5%.</p>

                    <p className='thirdpara1'>“The accuracy improvement for this front-and-center Bill.com feature really improved our end-user experience. iMerit proved to us that an annotation vendor can truly become a major business ally.” – Eitan Anzenberg, Chief Data Scientist, Bill.com</p>
